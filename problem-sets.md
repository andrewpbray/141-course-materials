# Problem Sets

Weekly problem sets to reinforce the concepts from the reading as
well as the material that we address in class. You're encouraged to work on the problem sets with fellow students, though you'll both need to turn in your own work.

Problem set guidelines:

1. All problem sets should be written in RMarkdown files and knitted to pdf.
2. pdfs should be submitted via gradescope.
3. Problem sets are practice. A good problem set will not only have the correct answers, it will be presented in a clean and easily understood way. Read over your pdf before submitting to be sure you're proud of it.

**PS1**: Will be listed here next week.
