# Syllabus

Welcome to the Age of Data, where information is all around us, helping us live 
happier, healthier lives. Or does it? Do we know yet if cell phones cause 
cancer? Have we come to a decision on whether we should be eating lots of meat 
or none at all to stay healthy? Despite all of this information, it can be 
challenging to turn it into the knowledge from which we can make sound
decisions.

Statistics is the field that aims to bridge this gap between information and 
knowledge and this course is an application-oriented introduction to modern 
statistical modeling and inference. We will discuss topics such as: study design, 
descriptive statistics, data visualization, random variables, probability and 
sampling distributions, point and interval estimates, hypothesis tests, 
resampling procedures, multiple regression, and Bayesian models. A wide variety 
of applications from the natural and social sciences will be used.

### Textbook

Primary: [OpenIntro: Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs) (2014),
by Diez, Barr and Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, available in three formats: pdf, 
tablet-friendly pdf, and paperback edition. The textbook is free and open-source,
but you're encouraged to purchase the paperback edition for roughly $10.

Secondary: [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/) by Ismay and Kim available free online or in print.

### Class components

This course has three components: Problem Sets, Labs, and Exams/Quizzes. For details
on the first two, see the tabs at the top of the page.

#### Problem Sets

Weekly problem sets to reinforce the concepts from the reading as
well as the material that we address in class. You're encouraged to work on the problem sets with fellow students, though you'll both need to turn in your own work.

Problem set guidelines:

- All problem sets should be written in RMarkdown files and knitted to pdf.
- pdfs should be submitted via gradescope.
- Problem sets are practice, both with the statistical concepts and with the process of producing a polished document. A good problem set will not only have the correct answers, it will be presented in a clean and easily understood way. Read over your pdf before submitting to be sure you're proud of it.


#### Exams

We'll have several examinations and quizzes throughout the semester in order to challenge your understanding and provide me with a sense of where you're at. Some will be more traditional pen and paper and others are to be done with the computer using R.

### Course Outcomes

By the end of the course, a student should be able to construct and critique an argument using data. Specifically, they shoudl be able to

1. Translate a research problem into a set of questions that can be answered by measurable statements about the parameters of a model or the characteristics of a data set.
2. Identify experiment and study design structures and explain how they impact potential conclusions.
3. Constructs a wide variety of graphics from data and describe what they do and do not reveal about the data.
4. Compute  summary  statistics and  provide  both  formal  and  informal  explanation  for  what  these  statistics represent.
5. Articulate statistical concepts in the language of probability.
6. Determine the appropriate model and statistical procedure for answering a particular research question from a given data set.
7. Utilize both computational and theoretical tools to perform statistical inference and linear regression.
8. Develop a reproducible workflow using R Markdown documents
