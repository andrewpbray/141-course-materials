Part I: OpenIntro

Chapter 1 exercises 3, 4, 5, 6, 37, 40.

Part II: Additional practice
----------------------------

1.  The data on iris flowers described in exercise 5 above are built-in
    to R. You can print out the data by simply including the name of the
    data set in an R chunk:

<!-- -->

    iris

In iris flowers, the petals are the smaller, usually purple, petals and
the sepals are the larger purple petal-like things that surround them
Based on the values that were recorded on each flower and what you know
about the size of flowers, what unit do you think these flowers were
measured in? \*So as to not clutter your final problem set with the full
data set, before you submit the document, toggle the r chunk so that it
does not run the code by adding `eval = FALSE` within the curly braces
so that the top line of your r chunk looks like
\`\`\``{r eval = FALSE}`.

1.  Construct a scatterplot that shows the relationship between
    `Petal.Length` and `Sepal.Length` and second scatterplot that shows
    the relationship between `Petal.Width` and `Sepal.Width`. Which
    dimension, width or length, shows a stronger association between
    petals and sepals? Be sure to load the `library(tidyverse)` before
    making your `ggplot`.

2.  Contruct a third scatterplot that is similar to the second, but map
    `color` to `Species`. Which species is generally the largest? Which
    species is least like the other two?
