Chapter 2 exercises 9, 13, 16, 18, 20

### Notes

  - For 2.9.c, please instead provide the `infer()` code that could
    perform the simulation. This won’t be real runable code (set the
    chunk option `eval = FALSE`), so just throw down sensible names for
    the data frame, the variables, and the levels of the variables.
  - Some exercises ask that you draw a picture of the normal curve and
    shade the relevant probability. You can do so by adapting the
    following code.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
library(tidyverse)
data.frame(x = c(-3, 3)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, 
            fill = "#00998a", xlim = c(-3, 0)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, 
            fill = "grey80", xlim = c(0, 3)) +
  theme_bw()
```

To adjust this to your use tinker around with the xlim argument in
`geom_area()` to figure out what it’s doing.
