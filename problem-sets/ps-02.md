Problem Set 02
================

## Part I: OpenIntro

Chapter 1 exercises 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 22

## Part II: Additional practice

Like R, OpenIntro is open-source, meaning that anyone can download and
modify all of the materials that make up the textbook. Exercise 10 above
shows a plot of the income and education levels of counties in the
United States. The data is made available in R in a package that you can
load in with the following.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(gghighlight)
data(countyComplete)
```

You can view the data set with `View(countyComplete)` and see its help
file with `?countyComplete`.

Recreate the scatter plot shown in the exercise. The aesthetics donâ€™t
need to match completely, but do improve the plot with a few
modifications:

1.  Highlight the counties of Oregon. This is made incredibly easy
    because of a small package build by a member of the R community
    called
    [`gghighlight`](https://yutannihilation.github.io/gghighlight/articles/gghighlight.html).
    Simply add `gghighlight(state == "Oregon")`.

2.  Add axis labels by adding the layer: `labs(x = "___", y = "___")`.

3.  Add a bit of transparency with the `alpha` option to your geom.

Does this plot demonstrate that the counties of Oregon are typical of US
counties generally or are they systematically different?
