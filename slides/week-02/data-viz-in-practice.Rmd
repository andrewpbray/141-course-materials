# Lessons in Practical Data Viz
--

1. Compare multiple `geoms` to see which one captures best the structure you're looking to emphasize.

2. Add clear/informative axis labels (or titles).

3. Think carefully about your scales (log-transform, palettes)

4. Don't be constrained by your code - ask for help!

---
# Your turn
--

Sketch the data frame and code that would create:

--

```{r out.width=650, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/lonely-bar-chart.png")
```

5. Be sure you understand - and faithfully convey - the unit of obs.

6. Use the taxonomy of data to guide your viz.

# Which line is the most meaningful?
--

```{r out.width=800, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/cancer-age.png")
```


---
# Which line is the most meaningful?

.pull-left[
```{r out.width=350, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/cancer-age.png")
```
]

--

.pull-right[
**Cancer Deaths**: sheer number of people that have died each year of cancer worldwide relative to the number in 1990.

**Cancer Death Rate**: number of people that die of cancer in a year divided by global population.

** Age-standardized Death Rate**: adjusts the death rate to account for changes in the age-demongraphics.

# Proportion of boys born in the US

--

```{r fig.height = 5, echo = FALSE}
library(oilabs)
data(present)
present %>%
  mutate(prop_boys = boys / (boys + girls)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = prop_boys)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "Proportion of boys") +
  theme_bw()
```

--

**Story**: The proportion of boys has been dropping over the last 60 years.

--

**Story**: There have consistently been more boys born in the US than girls.
